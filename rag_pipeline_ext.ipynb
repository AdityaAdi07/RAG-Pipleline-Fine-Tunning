      "\n",
      "1. **Avoid common similarity traps**: Ensure that your project title, description, and objective are unique by avoiding generic keywords and focusing on specific, innovative solutions.\n",
      "2. **Differentiate in title, description, and objective**: Use distinct language to differentiate your project from similar ones. Avoid copying phrases or sentences verbatim.\n",
      "3. **Best practices for making academically original work**:\n",
      "\t* Conduct thorough literature reviews to identify gaps in existing research.\n",
      "\t* Develop novel methodologies or approaches that contribute to the field.\n",
      "\t* Ensure that your project's scope and objectives align with the broader research question or problem statement.\n",
      "4. **Technical + conceptual strategies to reduce similarity**: Consider the following strategies to minimize similarity:\n",
      "\t* Use unique data sources or datasets not commonly used in similar projects.\n",
      "\t* Explore novel applications of existing technologies or techniques.\n",
      "\t* Develop a more comprehensive or integrated system that addresses multiple aspects of the problem domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these guidelines and suggestions, you can enhance the originality and uniqueness of your Smart Water Leakage Detection System project.\n"
